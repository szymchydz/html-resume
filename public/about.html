  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <div class="about-me">
    <p>As an employee, I offer over 13 years of experience in quality control and production process optimization in the polygraphy industry, along with 6 years of experience in an international production environment.</p>

    <p>I hold a Bachelor's degree in English Philology and a Bachelor of Engineering degree in Management and Production Engineering. Throughout my professional career, I have been actively involved in various aspects of production, including roles as an assembly department manager, process engineer, warehouseman, purchasing specialist, and production process coordinator. These diverse positions have equipped me with valuable skills and extensive production experience.</p>

    <p>During my time at Qubiqa Sp. z o.o., I became known for my flexibility and meticulous attention to detail. I also developed strong skills in human resource management and establishing long-term relationships with suppliers and subcontractors, which often led to the successful achievement of our goals. Working directly with customers in Denmark, I gradually improved the machine assembly process, enhancing efficiency and the quality of manufactured products.</p>

    <p>Transitioning to the polygraphy production sector at Colours Factory Sp. z o.o. further honed my ability to analyze production processes and adopt a customer-oriented quality approach.</p>

    <p>I thrive in an international environment, excelling under pressure and in high-stress conditions. I am adept at making difficult decisions and consistently delivering on assigned tasks. Previous employers have consistently valued my unwavering commitment, flexibility, attention to detail, and exceptional organizational skills. My colleagues perceive me as a positive team member who is always eager to share knowledge and provide support.</p>
